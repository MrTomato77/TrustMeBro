# TrustMeBro

A lightweight Windows tray application for toggling a specific IP blocking rule on/off using Windows Firewall ‚Äî inspired by tools like Cloudflare WARP. Designed for personal network testing and experimentation.

## ‚ú® Features

- üü¢ **Toggle Block**: Right-click the tray icon or press `Ctrl+F12` to enable/disable a specific Windows Firewall rule.
- üé® **Tray Icon Status**: Icon changes to indicate status (Power On = Active, Power Off = Inactive).
- üìå **Background App**: Runs in the system tray without opening a window.
- üö´ **No full GUI**: Interaction is via tray icon and hotkey only.

## üß∞ Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows OS**: This application is designed for Windows only, as it uses Windows Firewall (`netsh`) and Windows-specific APIs.
- **Python 3.8+**: Ensure Python is installed. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Administrator Privileges**: The application **requires** administrator privileges to modify Windows Firewall rules. If not run as an administrator, the program will exit automatically.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MrTomato77/TrustMeBro
cd TrustMeBro
```

### 2. Setup Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Verify Icon Files
Ensure the `icon` folder contains `power-on.ico` and `power-off.ico` in the correct path (`icon/power-on.ico` and `icon/power-off.ico`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

1. **Edit `TrustMeBro.py`**:
   - `rule_name`: Name of the Windows Firewall rule (default: `TrustMeBro`).
   - `remote_ip`: Set to a valid IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) to block outbound connections to that IP.
   - **Note**: Invalid IPs (e.g., `0.0.0.0` or `x.x.x.x`) will prevent the firewall rule from being created.

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   python .\main\TrustMeBro.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the App**:
   - **Hotkey**: Press `Ctrl+F12` to toggle the firewall rule.
   - **Tray Icon**: Right-click the system tray icon to toggle the rule or exit the app.

## üèóÔ∏è Compile to EXE (Optional)

Convert the script into a standalone `.exe` using [auto-py-to-exe](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/):

### 1. Install auto-py-to-exe

```bash
pip install auto-py-to-exe
```

### 2. Run the Tool

```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```

### 3. Configuration in auto-py-to-exe

- **Script Location**: Select `TrustMeBro.py`.
- **Onefile**: ‚úÖ (enabled).
- **Console Window**: ‚ùå (window-based / no console).
- **Additional Files**: Add the `icon` folder (containing `power-on.ico` and `power-off.ico`).

### 4. Click "Convert .py to .exe"

The output `.exe` will be generated in the `output` folder.

**Note**: If you modify `remote_ip` or other parts of the script, recompile the `.exe` to ensure changes take effect. Run the `.exe` as an administrator, or it will exit.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Administrator Privileges**: The script or `.exe` **must** be run as an administrator to modify Windows Firewall rules. If not, the program will exit automatically.
- **Valid IP Address**: Ensure `remote_ip` is a valid IPv4 address. Using invalid values (e.g., `0.0.0.0` or `x.x.x.x`) may cause the firewall rule to fail.
- **Use Responsibly**: This tool is for personal network testing only.
